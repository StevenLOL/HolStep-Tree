Feel free to acomplish the subtasks (and let me know :-) ).

Tuning network struture:

 - modified version (6) with ability of generation (prepared tensorflow_tree.make_gen_able_down_rnn)
  (i) do up_flow
 (ii) left_rnn is identity, right_rnn gets only the left subformula (not the current)
(iii) for every vertex guess whether it is a left descendant of other node and if so, guess its operation
 (iv) at every leaf guess the constant
 - implement actual generation based on guesses by (7)
 - some kind of attention ...

Side tasks:

More flexibility with tree-RNN inputs (not neccesarily the same dim)
  Split interface and dimension
Classic dropout (inside network, tf.nn.dropout)
Dependency selection (the 'D' lines) -- big output (negative sampling / hierarchical softmax)
Rewrite using Tensorflow Fold:

      Or not? Is it possible to store data on the tree in Fold?
