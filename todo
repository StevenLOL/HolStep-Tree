Feel free to acomplish the subtasks (and let me know :-) ).

Tuning network struture:

(1) guessing rest of formulas, inspired by word2vec, for better word embeddings, (prepared tensorflow_tree.make_blind_down_rnn)
  (i) do up_flow
 (ii) do down_flow such that left_rnn gets only the right subformula (not the current) and vice versa
(iii) at every node guess whether it is a constant, application or abstraction
 (iv) at every leaf guess the constant
(2) modified version (6) with ability of generation (prepared tensorflow_tree.make_gen_able_down_rnn)
  (i) do up_flow
 (ii) left_rnn is identity, right_rnn gets only the left subformula (not the current)
(iii) for every vertex guess whether it is a left descendant of other node and if so, guess its operation
 (iv) at every leaf guess the constant
(3) implement actual generation based on guesses by (7)
(4) some kind of attention ...

Side tasks:

More flexibility with tree-RNN inputs (not neccesarily the same dim)
  Split interface and dimension
Classic dropout (inside network, tf.nn.dropout)
Dependency selection (the 'D' lines) -- big output (negative sampling / hierarchical softmax)
Rewrite using Tensorflow Fold:
    https://github.com/tensorflow/fold/blob/master/tensorflow_fold/g3doc/sentiment.ipynb
      Or not? Is it possible to store data on the tree in Fold?
