Feel free to acomplish the tasks (and let me know :-) ).

 - Ability to log constants in char_emb mode
 - More flexibility with tree-RNN inputs (not neccesarily the same dim)
   - Split interface and dimension
 - Classic dropout (inside network, tf.nn.dropout)
 - Dependency selection (the 'D' lines) -- big output (negative sampling / hierarchical softmax)
 - Rewrite using Tensorflow Fold:
   - https://github.com/tensorflow/fold/blob/master/tensorflow_fold/g3doc/sentiment.ipynb
     - Or not? Is it possible to store data on the tree in Fold?
 - batching in generation?
 - some kind of attention ...
